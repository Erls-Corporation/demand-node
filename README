# Meowdio

# Purpose: To let turntable.fm know that they suck donkey balls.
# How: We are implementing a point system/competition for only 1 DJ at a time per room. 4 DJs are for gay clubs and gastropubs

# Features: 1 DJ per room. First served basis to the DJ booth. Will allow a 'gamble' system to take over the DJ booth. 
#						DJ voting system will work the same as turntable to allow next song or boot the DJ. All points are rewarded
#						in a 4square 'like' enviroment and badges. Points will also reward random score mulitipliers and possibly to
#						take over the DJ booth with no risk.
